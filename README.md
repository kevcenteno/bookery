# Bookery

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pseudomuto/bookery.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pseudomuto/bookery)

My own (very opinionated) custom tool for writing books. This is very much a work in progress right now.

## TODO's for a reasonable v1

* [ ] Build PDF
* [ ] Build Mobi
* [ ] Build ePub

## Installation

    $ gem install bookery

_If you're using rbenv, run `rbenv rehash` after the installation to ensure the shim is created_

## Creating a New Book

* `bookery new <path>`

## Publishing

From within the project directory:

* `bookery pub`

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
